# Hotdog Cookout Lab:
# Students will be provided the Pseudocode, then they are to create this in Python.

# Hot Dog Cookout Calculator

# Assume that hot dogs come in packages of 10, and hot dog buns come in packages of 8. 
# Design a modular program that calculates the number of packages of hot dogs and the number of 
# packages of hot dog buns needed for a cookout, with the minimum amount of leftovers. 
# The program should ask the user for the number of people attending the cookout, and the 
# number of hot dogs each person will be given. The program should display the following:

# 1. The minimum number of packages of hot dogs required.
# 2. The minimum number of packages of buns required
# 3. The number of hot dogs that will be left over
# 4. The number of buns that will be left over
